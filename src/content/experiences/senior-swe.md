## Overview

At Amazon, I serve as a Senior Software Engineer in the Platform Engineering division. My primary responsibility is to architect and maintain the core infrastructure that powers our high-scale consumer applications.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Architectural Leadership**: Designed and implemented a migration strategy from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture, improving system scalability and developer velocity.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identified bottlenecks in our data ingestion pipeline and implemented a caching layer using Redis, which reduced average response times from 300ms to 50ms.
- **Mentorship**: Actively mentoring 3 junior developers, conducting code reviews, and organizing weekly technical knowledge-sharing sessions.

## Technical Highlights

### Event-Driven Architecture
I led the design and implementation of an event-driven architecture using **Apache Kafka** to handle real-time user activity data. This system processes over 50,000 events per second with 99.99% reliability.

### Kubernetes Orchestration
Managed the deployment of over 50 microservices on **AWS EKS**. Implemented auto-scaling policies based on custom metrics to handle traffic spikes during peak hours, reducing infrastructure costs by 20%.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Go, Python
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka
