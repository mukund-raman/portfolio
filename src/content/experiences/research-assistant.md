## Research Focus

I worked under the supervision of Dr. Jane Doe in the Computer Vision Laboratory. Our research focused on improving object detection in low-light environments for autonomous vehicle applications.

## Contributions

- **Novel Algorithm**: Developed a new image enhancement preprocessing pipeline that uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to improve the visibility of objects in dark scenes without introducing noise.
- **Experimentation**: Ran extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating a **15% improvement** in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to baseline methods.
- **Publication**: Co-authored a paper titled "Low-Light Object Detection via Generative Enhancement", which was accepted for publication at CVPR 2021.

## Skills Gained
- Deep understanding of CNN architectures (ResNet, YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Proficiency in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
- Experience with academic writing and the peer-review process
