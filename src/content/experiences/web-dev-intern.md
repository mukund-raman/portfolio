## Early Career

This was my first professional role in software development. I joined a small team at a local startup building a community engagement platform.

## Contributions

- **Frontend Basic**: Implemented the initial frontend using vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- **Backend Support**: Wrote PHP scripts to handle form submissions and user authentication, interacting with a **MySQL** database.
- **API Integration**: Integrated the Google Maps API to display community events on an interactive map.

This experience solidified my passion for web development and set the foundation for my future learning.
