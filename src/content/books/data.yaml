    ## Review

    *Clean Code* is arguably the most influential book for software developers. "Uncle Bob" Martin presents a school of thought that prioritizes readability and maintainability above cleverness. While some examples (Java) feel dated, the principles are timeless.

    > "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

    ## Key Takeaways

    1.  **Meaningful Names**: Variables should answer *why* they exist, *what* they do, and *how* they are used. `int d; // elapsed time in days` is bad. `int daysSinceModification` is good.
    2.  **Functions**: Should do one thing, do it well, and do it only. If a function contains sections (e.g., declarations, initializations, logic), it's probably doing too much.
    3.  **Comments**: The goal is to express yourself in code. Comments are often a failure to make the code clear enough. "Don't comment bad code—rewrite it."
    4.  **Formatting**: Code is communication. Vertical openness between concepts and vertical density within concepts affect readability heavily.
    5.  **Error Handling**: Create clean boundaries between application logic and error handling. Prefer exceptions to return codes.

    ## Personal Impact

    Reading this book early in my career changed my mindset from "getting it to work" to "crafting it to last." I apply the **Boy Scout Rule** (Leave the campground cleaner than you found it) to every pull request I submit.

    ## Review

    While *Clean Code* focuses on the code, *The Pragmatic Programmer* focuses on the coder. It's a collection of tips and warnings that guide you towards becoming a simpler, more effective developer.

    ## Key Philosophies

    ### 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. This applies to code, documentation, and build scripts.

    ### 2. Orthogonality
    Unrelated things should not affect each other. If I change the database schema, the UI rendering logic shouldn't break. Decoupled code is easier to test and modify.

    ### 3. Tracer Bullets
    When exploring a new technology or architecture, build a thin slice of the application that works end-to-end (UI -> Logic -> DB). This validates the architecture early, unlike "prototypes" which are often thrown away.

    ### 4. Broken Windows
    Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them. Ignoring them implies that no one cares, which accelerates rot.

    ## Quote

    > "You can't write perfect software. Did that hurt? It shouldn't. Accept it as an axiom of life. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Because perfect software doesn't exist."

    ## Review

    Often referred to as the "Bible of Deep Learning," this textbook covers the mathematical and conceptual foundations of modern AI. It's dense, rigorous, and absolutely essential for researchers.

    ## Summary

    The book is divided into three parts:

    1.  **Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics**: Linear Algebra, Probability, Numerical Computation.
    2.  **Deep Networks: Modern Practices**: Feedforward Networks, Regularization (Dropout, L1/L2), Optimization (RMSProp, Adam), CNNs, and RNNs.
    3.  **Deep Learning Research**: Linear Factor Models, Autoencoders, Representation Learning, and Generative Models (GANs).

    ## Key Takeaways

    - **Regularization is Key**: The capacity of neural networks is massive. Without techniques like Dropout, Weight Decay, and Data Augmentation, overfitting is inevitable.
    - **Optimization Geometry**: The landscape of loss functions in high dimensions is complex. Saddle points are surprisingly more common and problematic than local minima.
    - **Representation Learning**: The true power of Deep Learning is its ability to learn a hierarchy of features without manual feature engineering.

    > "The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones."

    ## Review

    James Clear's *Atomic Habits* provides a practical framework for improving every day. The core thesis is that massive success doesn't require massive action, but rather small, consistent habits that compound over time.

    > "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

    ## Key Concepts

    ### The 1% Rule
    improving by just 1% every day results in being **37x better** by the end of the year. Conversely, getting 1% worse brings you to nearly zero.

    ### The 4 Laws of Behavior Change

    1.  **Make it Obvious**: Design your environment. If you want to floss, put the floss on your toothbrush.
    2.  **Make it Attractive**: Bundle habits. Do something you *need* to do before something you *want* to do.
    3.  **Make it Easy**: Reduce friction. Automation, prime the environment, keep the habit small (e.g., "Two Minute Rule").
    4.  **Make it Satisfying**: Use immediate rewards. Track your habits visually.

    ## Application to Engineering

    I use these principles to build better coding habits. For example, I use the "Two Minute Rule" to start documentation—I just promise to write one sentence. Usually, once started, I finish the whole doc.

    ## Review

    Fowler's catalog of refactoring patterns is indispensable. The book teaches you to recognize code smells and apply specific refactorings to fix them.

    ## Favorite Refactorings

    - **Extract Method**: Break long methods into smaller, named pieces
    - **Replace Temp with Query**: Eliminate temporary variables
    - **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group params that go together
    - **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: OOP over if/else chains

    The examples use Java, but the concepts apply to any language.

    ## Review

    A novel about IT and DevOps that somehow makes infrastructure exciting. Follows an IT manager saving a failing project through DevOps principles.

    ## Key Lessons

    - **The Three Ways**: Flow, Feedback, Continuous Learning
    - **Theory of Constraints**: Identify and eliminate bottlenecks
    - **WIP Limits**: Too much work-in-progress kills velocity

    ## Review

    The classic on web usability. Despite being written in 2000, the principles remain timeless.

    ## Core Principles

    - **Self-evident design**: Users shouldn't have to think
    - **Conventions are your friend**: Don't reinvent the wheel
    - **Less is more**: Remove anything that doesn't add value
    - **Test with users**: Watch 3 people use your product

    Changed how I think about frontend development entirely.
