## Review

James Clear's *Atomic Habits* provides a practical framework for improving every day. The core thesis is that massive success doesn't require massive action, but rather small, consistent habits that compound over time.

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

## Key Concepts

### The 1% Rule
improving by just 1% every day results in being **37x better** by the end of the year. Conversely, getting 1% worse brings you to nearly zero.

### The 4 Laws of Behavior Change

1.  **Make it Obvious**: Design your environment. If you want to floss, put the floss on your toothbrush.
2.  **Make it Attractive**: Bundle habits. Do something you *need* to do before something you *want* to do.
3.  **Make it Easy**: Reduce friction. Automation, prime the environment, keep the habit small (e.g., "Two Minute Rule").
4.  **Make it Satisfying**: Use immediate rewards. Track your habits visually.

## Application to Engineering

I use these principles to build better coding habits. For example, I use the "Two Minute Rule" to start documentation—I just promise to write one sentence. Usually, once started, I finish the whole doc.
